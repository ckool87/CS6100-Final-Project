# CS6100-Final-Project

Notes
Which languages to use?
Project topics
  Cybersecurity was removed as an option
  Clay - I was thinking of the BD research topic and looking into Cloud architecture for BD or something along those lines
    Maybe the noSQL topic as well
    Data mesh, cloud architecture, genetic algorithms, multi-cloud applications, cloud orchestration(like kubernetes), cloud data protection and privacy
    Basically whatever topics will translate the best to real world jobs and may look the best if put onto a CV/resume
